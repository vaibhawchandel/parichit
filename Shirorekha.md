# Shirorekha #

Devanagarai, Bengali and Gurmukhi scripts are written in a way where each word is marked by a line above it called as **Shirorekha**. This connects all the letters in a word and so segmentation has to be done before the scanned document image is passed on to the recognizer.

A Shirorekha segmenter will be made available on this project soon.
